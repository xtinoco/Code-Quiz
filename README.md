# Code-Quiz

For this weeks homework I have created a code quiz game on JavaScript fudamentals that stores high scores.


## Basic Functions
- Game begins when the start button is clicked
- A question appears 
- If the question is answered correctly then screen turns green and you can     click next for another question
- If the question is answered incorrectly the screen turns red
- You can restart when all questions are answered
