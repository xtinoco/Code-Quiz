# Code-Quiz

For this weeks homework I have created a code quiz game on JavaScript fudamentals that stores high scores.


##Basic Functions
- Game begins when the start button is clicked
- A question appears and a timer starts
- If the question is answered correctly then another question appears
- If the question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the timer
- Game ends when all questions are answered or timer reaches 0
- When the game ends you can save your initials and your score
